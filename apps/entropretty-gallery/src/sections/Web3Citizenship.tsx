          <p>
            Proof of Ink is the first digital individuality mechanism being
            developed for the Polkadot ecosystem. It uses tattoos as a way to
            prove unique personhood in a digital system, offering a novel
            approach to digital identity verification.

        <AccordionTrigger>How it Works</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          <p>
            The process works as follows: Users receive a{" "}
            <span className="keyword-highlight">unique tattoo design</span>{" "}
            generated on-chain using trustless entropy. This tattoo must be
            placed in a{" "}
            <span className="keyword-highlight">
              specific location on the body
            </span>
            , which is the same for all participants. To verify their
            participation, users submit evidence of getting the tattoo via a{" "}
            <span className="keyword-highlight">3-minute video</span>. This
            evidence is then judged by existing citizens through a voting
            process called <span className="keyword-highlight">"mob rule"</span>
            .
